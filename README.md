# Wiki
<p>A Wikipedia-style CRUD application made with Django.</p>

Functionality includes:
<ul>
  <li>Creating a new "wiki" entry</li>
  <li>Editing existing entries</li>
  <li>Deleting existing entries</li>
  <li>Viewing all existing entries</li>
  <li>Searching for entries by finding all entries where the search substring is included in the entry name</li>
  <li>"Random Page" button that brings you to a random entry</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially completed as part of Harvard CS50w. More styling and functionality was added to make it personalized.</p>

### See it in action <a href="https://mheyda-cs50w-wiki-demo.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><ins>here</ins></a>*. :smile:
*Note: Functionality for creating, editing, and deleting entries has been limited for the demo as it is a live application.
